# Quickstart

> On Windows, use `py run.py ...` (the Python launcher).  
> On macOS/Linux, use `python3 run.py ...` if `python` is not available.

## 1. Clone

```bash
git clone <repo-url> knowledge-system
cd knowledge-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 2. Create a Custom Vault (Recommended)

```bash
py run.py bootstrap
```

You will be prompted for:

- domain name (e.g. `Dogs`)
- note type slug (e.g. `breed-profile`)
- canonical sections (comma-separated, minimum 2)

This generates:

- a fully valid vault under `<domain-slug>-vault/`
- a domain-specific `vault_schema.py`
- matching canonical templates
- updated `config/config.yaml`

After this, the system is ready:

```bash
py run.py validate
```

---

## 3. Initialise Demo Vault (Optional)

```bash
py run.py init my-vault
```

This copies the predefined demo schema (19 core-concept notes, `fundamentals` domain). Use this to explore the system with an existing dataset. For a clean start with your own domain, use `bootstrap` instead.

---

## 4. Generate Templates (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
py run.py templates
```

Templates are derived from the schema and ensure structural consistency.

---

## 5. Run the Pipeline

```bash
py run.py validate
py run.py analyse
py run.py improve
py run.py report
```

---

## 5b. Generate a Context Bundle (Phase 2)

```bash
py run.py bundle
```

Prints a JSON context bundle to stdout. The bundle packages selected notes with metadata, section extracts, validation state, and budget information.

**Output shape:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "bundle_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8",
  "vault": "demo-vault",
  "filters": {"status": "complete"},
  "created_at": "2026-05-04T12:00:00+00:00",
  "validation_status": "pass",
  "notes": [...],
  "graph": {"related": {}},
  "budget": {"max_chars": 20000, "used_chars": 8500, "note_count": 5, "truncated": false},
  "warnings": [],
  "manifest": {"source_paths": [...], "schema_version": null}
}
```

**Defaults:** selects `status=complete` notes (falls back to all notes with a warning if none exist), extracts `Key Principles`, `How It Works`, `Trade-offs` sections, max 10 notes, 20 000-char budget.

`max_notes` caps the candidate pool first; `max_chars` then stops adding notes once the character budget is exhausted. `budget.truncated` is `true` only when notes were excluded by the character budget (not by `max_notes`). A `warnings` entry names the first note that was excluded by budget.

**Note:** bundle files are not written to disk in this phase. Export belongs to Phase 4.

## 6. Start API Server (Optional)

Requires the MCP dependencies (fastapi + uvicorn):

```bash
pip install -r mcp/requirements.txt
py mcp/server/mcp_server.py
```

---

## 7. Query the System

**Vault overview**
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/summary
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/vaults

**Validation, tasks, notes, quality, missing** — all accept an optional `?vault=<name>` query parameter:
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/validation
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/validation?vault=demo-vault
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks?limit=5
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks?vault=demo-vault&limit=5&min_priority=2
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/notes
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/notes?vault=demo-vault
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/quality
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/missing
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/gaps

**Context bundle** (POST with JSON body):
```json
POST /context/bundle
{
  "vault": "demo-vault",
  "filters": {"domain": "fundamentals", "status": "complete"},
  "include_sections": ["Key Principles", "How It Works", "Trade-offs"],
  "include_related": false,
  "include_body": true,
  "max_notes": 10,
  "max_chars": 20000,
  "allow_partial": false
}
```
All fields except `vault` are optional — the defaults above apply.

**Compare** (POST with JSON body):
```json
POST /compare
{"before": "Vault Files/Vault Report.md"}
```

**Relationship graph** — two forms, both accept a vault name:
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph?vault=demo-vault  *(query-param form)*
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph/demo-vault  *(path-param form)*
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph/demo-vault/related?node_id=note::Fundamentals/Algorithms.md
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph/demo-vault/missing?node_id=note::Fundamentals/Algorithms.md

**Query filter rules (POST /query)**
- Only schema-defined fields are accepted. Unknown fields, unsupported operators (e.g. `status__gt`), and `__in` with a non-list value all return `{"status": "error", "error": "INVALID_FILTER", ...}` with zero results.
- Supported operators: `field` (equality), `field__in` (list), `field__contains` (substring).

**Task output format**

Each task from `/tasks` includes:
- `path` — full vault-relative POSIX path (e.g. `Fundamentals/Algorithms.md`)
- `constraints` — writing constraints from the task engine
- `missing` — list of missing section names
- `instruction` — human-readable action

**Missing concepts note**

`/missing` requires `EXPECTED_CONCEPTS` to be defined in `vault_schema.py`. If it is empty or undefined, the endpoint returns a `MISSING_CONCEPTS_EMPTY` error (HTTP 422) rather than a silent success.

**Index freshness**
After editing, adding, or deleting a note file, the next API call automatically reflects the change (within a 2-second cooldown window). No server restart is needed.

## 8. Run Verification Tests (Optional)

Core tests (requires only `requirements.txt`):

```bash
py mcp/test_verify.py
```

Tests 11 and 15 (rate limiter, structured logging) import from the MCP server and require the API dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r mcp/requirements.txt
py mcp/test_verify.py
```
